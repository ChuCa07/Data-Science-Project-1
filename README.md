    **The Movie Database (TMDb)** is a collaborative film database. The project was founded in 2008 by Travis Bell to collect movie posters. The initial database was a donation from the free project Open Media Database (OMDb). This database has more 913000 movies (including the adults content). In this project, I analyze data about movies which are released in 2023.
